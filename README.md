# GitHub Workflow for Students

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a GitHub account, accept an assignment on GitHub Classroom, clone the repository using GitHub Desktop, and add the project to Eclipse.

## 1. Creating a GitHub Account

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Click on **Sign up** in the upper-right corner.
3. Enter your email address, create a password, and choose a username.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. You might need to verify your email address.
5. After setting up your account, sign in to GitHub.

## 2. Accepting an Assignment on GitHub Classroom

1. Your instructor will provide a link to the GitHub Classroom assignment.
2. Click on the link to open the assignment in your browser.
3. If prompted, authorize GitHub Classroom to access your GitHub account.
4. Click **Accept this assignment**. GitHub Classroom will create a repository for you with the assignment files.
5. Once the repository is created, youâ€™ll see a link to your personal assignment repository. Click on it to view your repo.

## 3. Cloning the Repository Using GitHub Desktop

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account.
3. In GitHub Desktop, click on **File** > **Clone Repository**.
4. In the pop-up window, select the **URL** tab and paste the URL of your assignment repository (found on GitHub after accepting the assignment).
5. Choose a local path where you want to save the repository on your computer, then click **Clone**.
6. The repository will be cloned to your computer, and you can now see the files in GitHub Desktop.

## 4. Adding the Project to Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse on your computer.
2. Click on **File** > **Import**.
3. In the import wizard, select **Git** > **Projects from Git**, then click **Next**.
4. Choose **Existing local repository**, then click **Next**.
5. Click **Add** to find your cloned repository folder. Navigate to the folder where you cloned your GitHub repository and select it.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Can't find the cloned repository in GitHub Desktop?** Make sure you copied the correct URL from GitHub and that you're logged into the correct GitHub account in GitHub Desktop.
- **Eclipse doesn't show the project correctly?** Check if your project files are correctly placed in the repository and try importing the project again using the correct import settings.
